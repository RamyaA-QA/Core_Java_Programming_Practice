import java.io.Serializable;

/*
 * Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream so that it can be easily saved to a file or transmitted over a network. 
 * Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is converted back into an actual Java object. 
 * Serialization is essential when you want to persist an objectâ€™s state or send an object across a network.

In Java, serialization is done using the Serializable interface and the ObjectOutputStream/ObjectInputStream classes.
 */

/*
 * Key Points:
To serialize an object, the class must implement the Serializable interface.
Serializable is a marker interface (it has no methods to implement).
Transient fields are not serialized.
The serialVersionUID is used to ensure compatibility during deserialization (versioning).
